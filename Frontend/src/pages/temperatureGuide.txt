So here’s a useful guide for assigning unique temperatures:
You can divide them into ranges based on climate vibes:

🟢 Cool to Mild (Ideal for plants, temperate cities)
Great for lush, green cities, forests, balanced climates
Range: 15°C – 20°C
Examples:

City A: 16°C

City B: 18°C

City C: 19.5°C

🟠 Warm (Still good for growth, edging toward hot)
Think Mediterranean or savanna-type cities
Range: 21°C – 27°C
Examples:

City D: 23°C

City E: 25.8°C

🔴 Hot (Tropical, desert, or heat-resistant flora)
These cities would have plants adapted to heat
Range: 28°C – 35°C
Examples:

City F: 30°C

City G: 34°C
